A Full Stack chrome extension built with the MEN stack in which the user can leave small notes on YouTube videos that can be accessed at any time.
Used Node.js along with Express to implement a REST API which sends user data to be stored in a MongoDB collection.
Utilized the YouTube data API (v3) to retrieve video titles to display to users when displaying their list of notes.
Authentication outsourced to the Google Identity API so that user accounts can be linked to their YouTube accounts.
